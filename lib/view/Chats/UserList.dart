// I have created a basic chat Application which has  main screen containing the list of user and when we tap on the list tile of any user then we move to the ChatScreen with that user they can talk in chat room and share anyfile pdf or image but when the current user is offline and he received some notification about receiving message then can make such that the received message is just highlighted or displayed little bit in the main screen with the list tile of the user from which the message is received and also the count of the total message just as it shown in any chat app or whatsapp or instagram chat section, can you do that in flutter
